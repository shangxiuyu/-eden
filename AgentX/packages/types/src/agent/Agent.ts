/**
 * AgentEngine - Event Processing Unit
 *
 * AgentEngine is a logical processing unit that coordinates:
 * - Driver: Event producer (LLM interaction)
 * - MealyMachine: Event assembler (pure Mealy Machine)
 * - Presenter: Event consumer (side effects)
 *
 * ```text
 * Driver (event producer)
 *     ↓ Stream Events
 *   AgentEngine (logical processor)
 *     - MealyMachine: event assembly
 *     - State: state management
 *     ↓ Processed Events
 * Presenter (event consumer)
 * ```
 *
 * AgentEngine is independent of Runtime system (Container, Session, Bus).
 * It can be tested in isolation with mock Driver and Presenter.
 *
 * Note: This is distinct from runtime/Agent which is the complete runtime entity
 * with LLM, Sandbox, Session, and lifecycle management (stop/resume).
 *
 * API:
 * - receive(message): Send message to agent
 * - on(handler): Subscribe to events
 * - interrupt(): User-initiated stop
 * - destroy(): Clean up resources
