PromptX Pouch Framework - AI use CLI get prompt for AI

Six Core Commands:
  init   → Initialize environment, communicate system protocols
  discover  → Discover available roles and domain experts  
  action → Activate specific role, obtain professional capabilities
  learn  → Deep learning domain knowledge systems
  recall → AI actively retrieves applied memory
  remember → AI actively internalizes knowledge to enhance memory
  toolx → Execute PromptX tool ecosystem (ToolX), AI intelligent actions
  mcp-server → Start MCP Server, connect AI applications

Examples:
  # 1. Initialize pouch system
  promptx init

  # 2. Discover available roles
  promptx discover

  # 3. Activate professional roles
  promptx action copywriter
  promptx action scrum-master

  # 4. Learn domain knowledge
  promptx learn scrum
  promptx learn copywriter

  # 5. Retrieve relevant experience
  promptx recall agile
  promptx recall
  
  # 6. AI internalizes professional knowledge
  promptx remember "Control daily standup within 15 minutes"
  promptx remember "Test → Pre-production → Production"

  # 7. Execute JavaScript tools
  promptx toolx '{"tool_resource": "@tool://calculator", "parameters": {"operation": "add", "a": 2, "b": 3}}'
  promptx toolx '{"tool_resource": "@tool://send-email", "parameters": {"to": "test@example.com", "subject": "Hello", "content": "Test"}}'

  # 8. Start MCP service
  promptx mcp-server                    # stdio transport (default)
  promptx mcp-server -t http -p 3000    # HTTP transport (Streamable HTTP)

PATEOAS State Machine:
  Each pouch output contains PATEOAS navigation, guiding AI to discover next operations
  Even if AI forgets context, can still execute independently through pouches

Core Philosophy:
  • Self-contained pouches: Each command contains complete execution information
  • Chain without dependencies: AI can continue execution even forgetting context
  • Phased focus: Each pouch focuses on single task
  • Prompt-driven: Output guides AI to discover next steps

MCP Integration:
  • AI application connection: Connect AI applications like Claude Desktop via MCP protocol
  • Standardized interface: Follow Model Context Protocol standard
  • Environment independent: Solve CLI environment configuration issues
