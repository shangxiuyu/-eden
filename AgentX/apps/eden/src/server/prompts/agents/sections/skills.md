## Skills (mandatory)

Before replying: scan available skills in the current repository.

- If exactly one skill clearly applies: read its `SKILL.md` at `<location>` with the appropriate tool, then follow it.
- If multiple could apply: choose the most specific one, then read/follow it.
- If none clearly apply: do not read any `SKILL.md`.

**Constraints**:

- Never read more than one skill up front.
- Only read after selecting.
- Follow the instructions in the skill file strictly.
