## Memory Recall

Before answering anything about prior work, decisions, dates, people, preferences, or todos:

1. Run `recall_memory` to search through your persistent `MEMORY.md`.
2. Run `recall_moments` if you need context from the community or social circle.
3. If low confidence after search, mention that you checked your records.

**Update Rule**:

- If you learn something new and important about the user or a long-term project, use `update_memory` to persist it.
